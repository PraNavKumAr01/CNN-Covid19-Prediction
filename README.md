# CNN-Covid19-Prediction

Developed a Covid 19 classifier using a Convulational Neural Network which takes in XRay images as inputs then turns them into layers and extracts relevant information from them which helps it classify it as Covid Positive or Covid Negative

Also implemented a GRAD CAM (Gradient Weighted Class Activation Method) to visualize the XRays and see what parts of the XRay influenced the descision made by the Model
